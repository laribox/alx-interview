# 0x02. Minimum Operations

## Project Overview
This project solves the **Minimum Operations** problem using Python. The goal is to calculate the fewest number of operations needed to generate exactly `n` characters of 'H' in a text file, using only two operations:

- **Copy All**: Copies the entire content of the file.
- **Paste**: Pastes the copied content.

Each operation counts as one step. The challenge is to find the optimal sequence of operations to reach exactly `n` characters.
