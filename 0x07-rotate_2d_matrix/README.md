# Rotate 2D Matrix

This project implements a function to rotate a 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8.10 on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- Code must follow `pycodestyle` guidelines (version 2.8.0).
- All files must end with a new line and be executable.

## Function Prototype

```python
def rotate_2d_matrix(matrix):
    """
    Rotates a 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise in place.

    Args:
        matrix (list of list of int): The 2D matrix to rotate.

    Returns:
        None: The matrix is modified in place.
    """
